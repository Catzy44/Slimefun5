# Localization

Follow our file format, otherwise the game cannot read your files.
We appreciate any help we can get to expand our Localization Database and make the game appeal to more people.

## File Layout

```
## Metadata
lang.name= (English Language Name) / (Localized Language Name)
lang.authors= (author(s))

## (Category Name)
key=value
```

Example

```
## Metadata
lang.name=German / Deutsch
lang.authors=TheBusyBiscuit

## Items
item.diamond.name=Diamant
```

Multiple authors shall be seperated with a comma (e.g. "TheBusyBiscuit, mrCookieSlime")
All available keys can be found inside the file [en_US.txt](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun5/blob/master/Language/en_US.txt)
