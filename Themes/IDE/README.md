# Themes

Follow our file format, otherwise the game cannot read your files.
We appreciate any help we can get to expand our Database of Themes for our Ingame IDE to make the IDE look much more appealing to more people.

## File Layout

The File Layout is pretty straightforward!
A Theme is stored as an '.xml' file with each key representing a hexadecimal color code.

Just copy an existing Theme and edit your colors.
You can use Google to pick out the colors you want to have.
